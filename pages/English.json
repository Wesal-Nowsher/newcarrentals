            "title":"Fuel Prices increasing, is switching to Electric or Hybrid Cars will be the solution?",
            "desc":"With a rise in fuel prices, we are seeing many users shifting from fuel-efficient cars to electric cars. If you're wondering which one is an ideal option, then this guide from Switch Car for car renting in Dubai will help you. We will go over the differences and benefits of the two in-depth.<br/><br/>If you're looking at renting a car, then you can contact us at Switch Car for car rent in Dubai and drive your favorite car. Let's take a look at a few benefits of switching to electric and hybrid cars. .<br/><br/>  *Less Pollution and A Less Road Tax.<br/><br/> The emissions are lower when it comes to electric cars, thereby contributing to lesser greenhouse gasses emitted. This can be very beneficial to urban areas on account of the gridlocked traffic that creates smog, thereby increasing atmospheric pollutants. When the emissions are low, it reduces the road tax as well. *Tax Incentives.<br/> The latest technologies utilized in electric vehicles are expensive, therefore they are costlier in comparison to regular cars. However, governments mitigate the additional charges through tax incentives in order to encourage users to purchase vehicles that are friendly to the environment.            .<br/><br/>            *Instant Torque.<br /> Electric cars provide maximum and instant torque rating. So, you no longer need to wait for the engine to rev. This is a distinct feature that allows hybrid vehicles to perform similarly to gasoline vehicles.            .<br/><br/>  *No Idling.<br/>  You will no longer be burned when you're stuck in traffic with an idling engine. In terms of electric cars, they automatically power off when stuck in traffic and stationed at a signal. The car utilizes battery power to enable the AC and radio  *A Decrease in the Cost of Fuel.<br />  Electric and hybrid cars are known to utilize less and, in some cases, no fuel at all, reducing the overall cost incurred on fuel otherwise. Electric cars are equipped with batteries that can be charged at a cost that is way less than what you would incur on fuel. When you calculate the overall cost incurred with a fuel car, electric cars are much cheaper.            .<br/><br/> *Car Brand.<br />   With many users switching from fuel-powered cars, there is a huge range of various brands providing electric vehicles. Therefore, you can now select a car that matches your budget and your taste.            <br /><br /> *Boost The Resale Value<br />  Electric vehicles are technical, therefore when you plan to resell your vehicle, you will get a higher value on account of the reduced depreciation in comparison to fuel cars.            <br /><br />  *Developing Proper Driving Habits<br />  Many electric vehicles have a tutor system installed that guides the driver to use the vehicle in a way that is fuel-efficient. The car discourages the driver from high revs. It also encourages breaking down gradually. This system is very beneficial and helps the driver develop proper driving habits.            <br /><br />  Overall, electric vehicles have increased benefits, however, if you are not looking to purchase one right away, you could rent a car in UAE from Switch Car we offers cars at cheap rates."

            "title":"How to Prevent My Car from Catching Fire in Summer?",
            "desc":" In summer, many of us read about the condition of cars, especially when it comes to catching fire. However, if you maintain your car properly, you won't have to worry about this situation. If you don't own a car and are planning on renting one, you can rent a car in Dubai from Switch Car rental company.  A responsible car owner will do everything possible to keep his car safe by avoiding common fire causes. Here are a few helpful tips: <br/><br/>             1* Regular Maintenance of The Car<br/>  This is a vital step to avoid car fires. As a responsible car owner, you must make sure that your vehicle is regularly and properly maintained. The car has oil in it, which is known to be a flammable substance and is also particularly important for the vehicle to work safely. But there is a possibility for the oil to leak onto the engine of the car. This increases the potential risk of fire. When your car is regularly maintained, these risks can be averted.            <br/><br/>  2*Avoid Distractions<br/>  If a driver is distracted, there is a high chance that he will meet with an accident. Some common accidents include head-on collisions. When two engines collide, the engines suffer the greatest amount of damage. This risks the spillage of oil or even damage to the fuel tank. In such a situation, there is a risk of instant fire, risking the lives of the people involved in the accident. This could include the driver using his phone or talking to another person. Never text while you drive. Changing the radio station or putting on makeup while you drive is also dangerous. Many times, the driver is also distracted while having an argument with a friend or family member while driving. It was always recommended to stay focused on driving and avoid doing other things. Maintaining your car is important in order to avoid unforeseen incidents.             <br/><br/> There are certain things, safety measures that you could follow to prevent this kind of accident:             <br/>  1. While driving, if such an incident occurs, do not panic. Alert the other drivers by turning on the hazard lights and stopping at a safe location.            <br/>  2. Turn off your engine and make sure every passenger steps out of the vehicle immediately.            <br/>  3. You must then connect with the Dubai police or civil defense of your location.            <br/>  4. If the car has a fire extinguisher, preferably a powder one, determine where exactly the fire originated. Suppose it's in the hood. Spray the fire extinguisher through the gap in the hood. Make sure that the extinguisher is spread in a direction that is windward.mThis will keep you from inhaling the toxic fumes or even getting burnt.            <br/>  5. Prevention is better than cure, so avoiding such an incident is important in order to prevent the unwanted hassles of insurance claims. It is also important to keep the family safe from such events.            <br/>  If you're planning to rent a car that has already regular maintenance, you can contact Switch Car for car rental service in Dubai.

            "desc":"A car's battery plays a crucial role in getting it charged and starting in the first place. You can't drive a toy car if the battery isn’t performing the way it should. Even if one prefers a budget rent a car in Dubai from Switch Car, He must know when to replace his car batteries. <br/><br/>  When your car gives you these signs, make sure to follow through and check beneath the car’s hood to find the real problem.            <br/><br/>   ●Signs to identify a Dead Car Battery<br/>  Different car models would show signs differently. However, a few issues remain common no matter what car you drive. Since a car battery tends to push the vehicle on the road, its health would determine the other things inside it. <br/><br/>               So look for these signs to determine whether your car’s battery is dead or drained: <br/>  ■Turning on the Ignition Key Does Not Turn on the Engine<br/>            When you turn on the car's ignition key, the starter motor will crank, and so will the engine kickstart automatically. However, when the car battery is in poor health, it would not supply enough power to the engine, and due to this, the engine would repeatedly click only to stop at the end.            <br/><br/> ■The “Check Engine” Sign on the Dashboard<br/>  The dashboard of a car has a “Check Engine” light which would probably go bonkers if there is trouble with the engine or the car’s battery. There is a high chance that when you take your car to the service station, the mechanic will identify a drained battery as a problem considering that the “check engine” light warning is not an unusual problem when it comes to a car battery.            <br/><br/>  ■Problem With Turning on the Radio & Headlights<br/>  In case of your Radio or car headlights not turning on or headlights throwing a dim light on the road, the battery is probably already dead or about to be dead. At times. Corroded wiring of the battery might be a cause. So it is best not to overlook these signs.            <br/><br/>   ■The Battery Case Taking Unusual Shape<br/>   In overly hot & humid zones like in Dubai, chances are the battery case would swell up or may even crack up. There would be a high chance of battery acid leaking out then, which is quite dangerous. Hence, a battery that has turned into a shape other than rectangular must be discarded and recycled.            <br/><br/>   There may be several different unusual ways your car might be giving hints about a battery that needs to be replaced. Such professionals like us, Switch Car for rental services in Dubai inspect our batteries weekly. <br/><br/>            "
